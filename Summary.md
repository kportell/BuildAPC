# Summary
I hope you've enjoyed this short tutorial on building your own PC.  Building and designing your own PC means you'll get precisely what you wanted or needed.  You'll feel the joy of completing your own  computer and a sense of accomplishment from researching every piece along the way.  Once you've built your own PC you won't want to buy a pre-made one again!

In the next tutorial we will put together your PC and create a template you can use for future project builds.
