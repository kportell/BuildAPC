# Terms
Before starting this journey it is important to understand some of the terms we will be using.  Study the list below before moving to the next section, but you can always refer back to it later.  

CPU - Central Processing Unit - The brain of the computer.  The CPU executes commands that run the computer at a hardware level. 

RAM - Random Access Memory - Just like the name suggests, this is the computers short term memory.  It will store information as long as the computer is powered on.  

Motherboard - The motherboard connects everything together.  Every part is connected to the motherboard.  

Storage - Hard drives that store information even when the power is off.  

Peripherals - Additional utilities connected to the PC such as a keyboard and a mouse, which are both used to input data into the computer by the user. 

Monitor - The way you view the output of your computer.  Think of it as a TV for your computer that only shows what you put into it.  

Case - Each computer has to have a physical container to house it.  This is called a computers case.  

Power supply - Computers cannot run without power.  Power supply's are used to provide power to the computer and regulate how much electricity is allowed to flow into your motherboard. 

OS - Operating System - The Operations System controls most of the computers user facing functions.  If you are a new user, you probably use Microsoft Windows or MacOS.  More experienced users may try their hand at Linux or Unix.  

PC - Personal Computer 

GPU - Graphics Processing Unit - Like the CPU, the GPU processes input commands from the user an software.  The difference is that the GPU processes mostly graphics related commands, allowing for better computer performance by taking the pressure off of the CPU.  

HDD - Hard Disk Drive - A physical storage medium that uses spinning magnetic disks to store data even when the power is turned off. 

SSD - Solid State Drive - A physical storage medium that stores date on electric circuits. 

USB - Universal Serial Bus - a fast method of transferring data commonly used to connect the mouse and keyboard to the motherboard.  

HDMI - High Definition MultiMedia Interface - Transmits audio and video at very hi resolution.
