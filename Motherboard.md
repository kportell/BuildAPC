# Motherboard

Motherboard's have different form factors, that is to say, they have different sizes and shapes.  A motherboards size and shape is its form factor.  There are three main form factors of motherboards, ATX, DTX, and ITX.  Its important to know 

#### ATX
The base ATX form factor is used in the majority of desktops.  This is especially true for home desktop PC's.  It has input and output ports and a mid-sized profile for improved air flow over the board.  Developed by Intel in 1995, it is 12 inches by 9.6 inches and is used in most modern desktops.  Standard ATX form factor provides enough ports and slots for most of your computer needs.  

ATX form factors also include MicroATX, ExtendedATX, and FlexATX.  MicroATX is smaller coming in at 9.6 inches by 9.6 inches.  It has fewer ports and slots, but the added room in your case leaves space for using dual graphics cards.  Helpful if you need multiple card inputs for games and media.  ExtendedATX is larger, providing more slots and ports and double the slots for RAM.  FlexATX is built on the MicroATX form factor, but has different mounting holes for more case flexibility.  

#### DTX
DTX is a subset of ATX form factors.  It can be as small as 6.7 inches by  up to 9 inches.  Smaller than the MicroATX, but larger than the MiniITX, it has two less slots and a lower profile and a smaller case footprint.  DTX is not widely used and is primarily beneficial for small, low profile computers, especially helpful for small spaces.  

#### ITX
ITX is used for small computers that need to fit in small spaces.  There are two types of ITX form factors.  MiniITX and PICOITX.  MiniITX is known for its lower power consumption, smaller size, and passive cooling ability.  Embedded computers and in-vehicle computers are the primary market for this form factor.  PICOITX allows for more RAM than ITX, up to 2GB.  

As you can see, size matters when it comes to motherboards.  Deciding whether you want a full on desktop PC or a lower profile PC that takes space into consideration will guide the choosing process.  Make sure you do your research.  Things to consider are the socket type of your processor, the amount of RAM and type of RAM you want, and how many additional devices will need to be connected to it.
