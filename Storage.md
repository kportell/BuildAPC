# Storage
Computer storage has lots of uses and variations, but when building your PC, the primary storage used are hard drives.  Hard drives store information permanently even when the power is disconnected.  Some things to consider when choosing your storage is capacity, speed, and durability.  There are two types of hard drives, HDD's and SSD's.  

#### HDD
Hard Disk Drives use magnetic storage on spinning disks.  HDD's are cheap which allows you to have a large capacity for a low price.  While there are varying speeds of HDD's, they are slower than SSD's and less durable.  If the disk moves to much, the disk reader head can touch the disk causing it to stop, or shut down.  Additionally, read and write speed is slower than SSD's.  

#### SSD
Solid State Drive's use circuit boards to store date.  It is faster than HDD's and since there are no moving parts, it is more durable.  However, SSD's are significantly more expensive.  As a result, SSD's usually have lower capacity.  

The price of HDD"s make it ideal for normal computer storage of files and objects.  But the speed and durability of SSD's make it ideal for Operating Systems and storage you need to access quickly like game files.  This makes the hybrid approach to storage very appealing.  The hybrid approach uses multiple drives.  The SSD is used for the OS to provide fast storage for OS files and install programs.  The HDD is usually bigger and provides mass storage for files and objects that don't require lightening fast access.  HDD and SSD connectors use the same power connectors, and modern motherboards provide a port for both HDD and SSD drives.
