RAM stands for Random Access Memory.  This is temporary storage, anything stored in RAM disappears once the power is turned off.  RAM is fast and incredibly important to a smooth running system.  RAM is essential for fast processing of information and gaming.  While there are multiple types of RAM which include VRAM and Cache Memory, we will focus on computer RAM that plugs into the motherboard.  There are four times of computer RAM.  DRAM, SDRAM, RDRAM, and SRAM.  

DRAM, or Dynamic RAM, is the most common type of RAM for personal computers.  It comes in various speeds and is priced reasonably but is slower than the other types of RAM.  Even with power, information stored on DRAM decays overtime and has to be constantly refreshed.  DRAM is primarily used for standard computer memory. 

SDRAM, or Synchronous Dynamic RAM, synchronizes the RAM speed with the CPU clock speed.  Access speed is thus increased making SDRAM a better, but more expensive, choice for gaming and more advanced processing.  

RDRAM, or Rambus Dynamic RAM, is not used much anymore but was popular in the late 90's and early 00's.  RDRAM was primarily used for video gaming and on graphics cards.  

SRAM, or Static RAM, is more expensive than DRAM and SDRAM, but is also faster than both.  Information stored on SRAM is permanent as long as power is supplied to it.  It does not decay over time like DRAM does.  However, SRAM is used primarily for caching in CPU processes.  Its cost, size, and power consumption make it very expensive to use for main computer memory.  

#### Memory Modules
Memory module type is determined by the motherboard, so again you will need to research your motherboard before adding RAM.  

DIMM - Dual Inline Memory Module - used for main memory and has two unconnected lines that connect to the PC.  DIMM's are faster than SIMM's.  DIMM's support 64-bit data flow.  

SIMM - Single Inline Memory Module - previously used for main memory with a single unbroken line of circuits that connect to the motherboard.  SIMM's are considered obsolete in modern computers.  

SODIMM - Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module - half the size of a DIMM and is used for portable devices like laptops.  

As a general rule its always good to have more memory than you need than less.  However, how much memory you can use is dependent on your motherboard.  RAM must be considered during your research of your motherboard.  An otherwise good system can be hamstrung by not having enough RAM.
