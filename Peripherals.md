# Peripherals
Peripherals are devices that connect to the computer core and enhance its abilities or uses.  Some common peripherals are the mouse, keyboard, and monitor.  We will also discuss external drives.  There are multiple ways to connect your peripherals, but the two most common ways is through USB and HDMI.  More advanced and lesser used connections exist but we won't specifically cover them in this tutorial.  

#### USB
USB is one of the most common connection types.  It stands for Universal Serial Bus.  USB-A is a standard USB socket.  Its speeds are the slowest.  USB-B is frequently used for printers and external hard drives. USB Mini-B and Micro-B are used for smart phones and smaller personal devices.  USB-C is the new kid on the block but is quickly becoming the standard for smart devices and is even gaining use in the PC desktop area.  

There are several revisions of the USB standard, each an improvement on the previous revision.  USB 1.1 was the first standard.  It is now obsolete, but had a transfer speed of 12 Mbps and was the initially adopted by keyboard and mouse manufacturers.  USB 2.0 improved speeds to 480 Mbps, has backward compatibility with USB 1.1 devices, and can be used for high power and high transfer devices like mass storage peripherals.  USB 3.0 (USB 3.1 Gen 1) improves speeds even further to 4.8 Gbps and offers backwards compatibility.  USB 3.1 (USB 3.1 Gen 2) improves speeds to 5 Gbps and is able to be used with Apple MacBook.  USB 3.2 updates USB-C to be able to run at 20 Gbps.  USB 4.0 improves speeds to 40 Gbps with USB4 Version 2 tripling speeds to 120 Gbps.  

#### Mouse
Mice used to connect to computers via a ps/2 connector.  Modern mice connect via USB, Bluetooth, or Infrared.  The mouse controls a cursor your screen that allows you to interact with the software running on the computer.  It is a method of input.  A gaming mouse provides better performance directly connecting to the computer, while wireless mice allow more flexibility and freedom and range of motion. 

#### Keyboard
Keyboards allow you to input information into the computer via keys representing letters, numbers, and symbols.  Keyboards come in different forms, from ergonomic designs to basic rectangles.  There are digital keyboards, holographic keyboards, and mechanical keyboards.  

#### Monitor
The monitor you get will need a good amount of research as well as a very detailed understanding of what you need it for.  Most modern monitors connect via HDMI cables designed to transmit high resolution graphics.  A monitors resolution, size, and shape are all important to your ideal set up.  If you are sitting close to the monitor, you want a size that allows you to see the screen comfortably.  You'll also need to balance budget with video needs.  A true 4k display may be a nice addition, but remain out of budget.  Do you need one monitor, or two? Often times business needs dictate the need for two monitor or more.
