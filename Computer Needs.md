# Computer Needs
First thing we need to do is determine WHAT you need the PC to do.  You will need to ask yourself a few simple and a few difficult questions.  Lets walk through these questions.  

1. What will be the computers primary function in your life?
	- This will guide your thought process from here on out.  Will this be used for gaming? Maybe school projects and classes? Or perhaps you need it for advanced processing and scientific calculations.  Being new to building computers doesn't mean new to using computers. 
2. How much storage will you need?
	- This depends on what you are doing.  For example, if you work a lot on digital media, you likely need more storage for large files.  This will also guide what type of storage you need.  HDD storage is cheap, SSD storage is more stable, and sometimes a hybrid approach is best.  
3. How much memory will you need?
	- As a general rule, more is better.  However, motherboards support different types of memory as well as different amounts.  It is important to know your motherboard specifications before you choose your RAM. 
4. What size of case will you need?
	- Case size is important because you will need room for storage and graphics cards as well as the power supply and other cooling devices (fans, heat sinks, ect.) 
5. What is your budget?
	- Such an important question. It can be difficult to balance your computer needs with your budget.  I'll provide budget friendly options and performance options in this tutorial.  

Its important to define what you need before hand and not as you go.  The planning process is very important.  Performance, budget, space and power requirements needs to be clearly defined before you start purchasing parts.  Its also important to know WHERE to purchase your parts.  Below I have listed a few good sites for purchasing quality parts at reasonable prices.

Additionally, look locally for computer parts stores.  Midwest stores like MicroCenter and Fries Electronics provide a wide array of parts with solid warranties and return policies.  There are literally hundreds of different stores like this nation wide.  Search for local stores in your area.
