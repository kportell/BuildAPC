# Case and Power Supply

#### Case
The size of your case will depend on the motherboard you have chosen.  Large tower cases provide more than enough room for all your parts, but also take up a lot of extra space in your office or living space.  By contrast, a low profile case, while slim and small, leaves much less room for parts and requires a much smaller motherboard.  Gaming PC's use tower cases and provide the best option for systems that will require a separate graphics card.  

#### Power Supply
Power supply choice will require a bit of math.  You will need to note the power requirements of each fan, hard drive, and peripheral attached to the machine.  A variable power supply is optimal but also costs more, but provides two different power settings.  But keep in mind a bigger power supply will also need a bigger case, and the more power you have the more you can plug in safely.  But too much and you are wasting money and energy.
