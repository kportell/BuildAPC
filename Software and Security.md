# Software and Security

#### Operating System
If you are building your own PC, the first software that you have to pick out is the Operating System.  An Operating System is software that manages computer hardware, software, and user interaction with the computer.  The most popular OS for the PC is Microsoft Windows.  Its important to get a legitimate copy and not a downloaded or pirated version.  Piracy is stealing software, or downloading it with a bit of code that lets you use it for free.  These pirated copies of software often have virus's and can limit software functionality.  Since you didn't pay for it, it doesn't come with support and you will likely face issues upgrading it.  So get a legal version of Microsoft Windows.  The installation is straight forward, just follow the prompts. 

Another OS that is used a lot by more experienced computer users is LInux.  LInux has literally hundreds of version, or you can download and compile your own version.  This is much more advanced and requires a bit of experience or the desire to be adventurous.  

#### Anti-Virus
A computer virus is a piece of code that, when inserted into the computer system, can replicate and cause damage to a computer.  There are lots of types of virus's but you don't need to know all of them.  What you need to know is that they are bad and have to be prevented from harming your computer.  The way to do this is two fold.  First, be careful of what you download.  Whether from websites or emails, most virus's get on your computer by downloading yourself.  Second is to have a good anti-virus program.  An anti-virus program scans files on your computer and quarantines or deletes virus's.  Anti-virus programs check files against a list of virus definitions that are updated frequently. 

Common Anti-Virus programs include:
Norton's Anti-Virus
McAfee's
AVG
Sophas
Webroot

Some charge a monthly fee, others a one time purchase, and some are actually free.  Do your research before picking out what is best for you.  

#### Firewall
A firewall is a program that protects your computer from outside threats attempting to connect to your computer.  Windows comes with a fairly good but basic firewall.  As a best practice, all traffic coming in should be denied and most traffic out should be denied.  Specific ports can be opened to allow specific programs access in and out of the computer.  Firewalls can be complicated so I recommend using Windows built in Firewall if you are a beginner.  

#### Operating System Updates
One of the most important thing you will do for your computer is make sure the OS is up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  Windows Update can be set to automatic during OS installation and I highly recommend this.  Updates patch security holes in your OS, provide updated drivers, and code feature updates.  Its important to always keep your PC up to date.
