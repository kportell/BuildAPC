# Building your first computer!
#### By Kent Portell

##### Summary:
Building your own computer can be a very satisfying project.  From picking the best CPU and graphics card, to choosing how much ram and storage you want, creating a computer that best suites your needs is both an art form and a technical engagement.  There is a lot of work that goes into it, but once you finish, you have precisely what YOU wanted.  This tutorial will walk you through the the choices, pitfalls, and benefits of building a computer.  If its your first time, I will provide you with everything you need to build your Master PC.  For all of you experienced builders, this will still be a nice refresher and may give you new ideas and processes to consider during your next build! 

##### Getting Started
This tutorial will be broke up into 10 sections.  The first section will deal with the terms and definitions that will be used in this tutorial.  Some you may already know, and some terms may be new to you.  In the second section we will determine what your needs are as a computer user.  The computer needed for a writer, an internet user, and a gamer are vastly different.  What you need the PC for will determine what parts you will need to purchase to build it.  While this tutorial will be outlining building a gaming computer, I will provide multiple options for various needs.  Each of the following sections will deal with a particular piece of the puzzle and explain what each does.  And finally, we will finish off the tutorial with a discussion about software, OS updates, and security.  We will save putting the computer together for a separate tutorial as it involves specific connectors and a detailed description of how everything fits inside the case.  

But enough with the explanations, lets get started discovering what you need to build your first PC!
