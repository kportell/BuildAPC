# CPU

There are two main CPU makers.  AMD and Intel.  Both companies create a wide range of CPU types servicing different needs and pricing requirements.  

#### AMD 
AMD provides some serious fire power for a CPU with the Ryzen card.  The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the self proclaimed fastest gaming CPU the world has ever seen.  Benchmarks uphold this statement.  (Benchmarking is performance testing of computer parts) This CPU boasts 3D V-Cache technology to boost gaming performance, 104MB of on board memory, and the most advanced processor cores.  
On the other end of the spectrum we have the Ryzen 5 7000x series.  With lower on board memory and lower processing speed, the Ryzen 5 is a significant step down from the Ryzen 9 series.  However, it offers a dramatic cost decrease.  While not as powerful, if your every day tasks are for work and browsing, this CPU is more than enough, and helps keep your budget low.  
AMD also offers processors with built in AI in some of its higher end CPU's.

#### Intel
Intel has several different processors to choose from.  Gaudi series CPU's have AI built in the same as AMD does. But Intel also has options for datacenter processing with the Xeon processors.  The Core Ultra processors also embed AI in the processor.  For IoT (internet of things) and mobile devices, the Atom processor is one of the best.  For high performance in desktop PC's you will likely want to stay with a Core Ultra i9 series.  With 100MB+ on board memory, and 12 cores, the i9 offers maximum performance for gaming and advanced processor.  Intel's onboard graphics are good if you don't need it for gaming. 
If you are on a budget, the Core i5 series provides everything you need to browse the web and do your daily work.  The price drop for i9 to i5 is, again, dramatic.  The onboard graphics are enough for streaming video in high definition.  Definitely a budget choice, as some advanced levels of processing will not be possible.

#### Benchmarking

Before making any decisions about your CPU, research each CPU's benchmark performance.  Below are some of the best sites for benchmarking.  They do the work.  These sites provide specs, testing results, and performance ratings.

[CPU User Benchmarks](cpu.userbenchmark.com)
[Tom's Hardware](www.tomshardware.com)
[PassMark](www.passmark.com)

Once you've done your research and know the processor you want, you are ready to pick out your motherboard.  The reason I'm covering the CPU first is that CPU's have socket sizes and shapes.  As a result, not every CPU works with every motherboard.  We will cover motherboard form factors in the next section.
